Sometimes I see things

I have three Ray Hunters setup for comparison testing.

One with no sim at all. (nosim)
One with an old AT&T sim with no service. (deadsim)
One with a Google Fi sim with service. (goodsim)

I don't always have them all with me.

The filenames are the timestamp the collection started, dash, which hardware, dot, filetype.
Filetypes are:
raw qmdl
converted pcap (done by Ray Hunter from the webui)
txt of what I know about the capture
